## Planning and scoping

### Explain the importance of planning for an engagement.

#### Understanding the target audience

Target audience may be management, technical teams, etc. Usually pentest report has several groups to target, each of them having different:
* needs (operational planning, resource allocation, approval, etc.)
* position in the organization
* knowledge of the report topic
* responsibility or authority to make decisions based on the report
* demographics (age, alliances, attitudes, etc.)

Report written without understanding of target audience is unclear and useless.

#### Rules of engagement

Rules describe expectations for client and limitations or rights for testers.

Testers should agree with the client on the following:
* when active portions of testing are performed? during business hours, after business hours, on the weekends, etc.
* which hosts, networks, domains & other resources are being tested, and which are not
* black box, white box, grey box
* will client's security team know about the engagement
* will client's employees know about the engagement
* are there appliances which may impact the effectiveness of attacks, such as IPS, firewall, WAF, load balancer, etc.
* what are the acceptable social engineering pretexts
* is it allowed to DoS-test clients infrastructure

This list is not full, additional rules and restrictions may be imposed.

Without engagement rules, pentest will produce unexpected and unwanted results and will not serve client's objectives.

#### Communication escalation path

Communication path and method is important for customer satisfaction, confidentiality of findings, incident handling (e.g. server has crashed after execution of a payload).

#### Resources and requirements

##### Confidentiality of findings

Confidentiality of findings is very important since pentest unveils vulnerabilities in clients networks.

In case of loss of findings confidentiality, vulnerabilities (findings) may be exploited by threat actors resulting in an incident for the client.

##### Known vs. unknown

Requirements & resource needs might be formalized at the beginning of engagement, but may change as the pentest progresses.

Agile vs Waterfall.

#### Budget

Budget is important because engagement is a service provided by the pentesting firm to the client, in exchange for money.

Volume of testing, chosen methodology, quality etc. is budget-dependent. The bigger is the budget, the more time pentesting firm is able to allocate to pentest, the more qualified personnel it is able to involve in the project, etc.

Pentesting firm, from a financial perspective, is interested in minimizing expenses and maximizing revenue (compensation according to the contract), keeping quality of provided services at a level acceptable by the client.

Client in this case is interested in minimizing expenses and maximizing amount (scope, working hours)/quality of services provided by the pentesting firm. Of course, for the client hiring a pentest firm is also an investment, which is aimed at increased revenue/trust/etc. or decreased number of vulnerabilities, risk, financial losses due to incidents, etc.

A win-win between pentesting firm and client has to exist in order for the pentest to be successful.
